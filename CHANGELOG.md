# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- initial public Tarn release
- YAML-based API tests in `.tarn.yaml`
- structured JSON, JUnit, TAP, HTML, and human output
- setup/teardown, captures, cookies, includes, polling, retries, Lua scripting
- GraphQL support
- MCP server (`tarn-mcp`)
- benchmark mode (`tarn bench`)

## 0.4.0

### Bug Fixes

- **Unresolved template detection** (NAZ-233): steps using `{{ capture.x }}` or `{{ env.x }}` that failed to resolve now fail immediately with a clear error (`failure_category: "unresolved_template"`) instead of sending garbled requests with literal `%7B%7B` in URLs
- **Lua `json` global** (NAZ-231): `json.decode(string)` and `json.encode(value)` are now available in Lua scripts — previously `json` was nil at runtime
- **MCP env var resolution** (NAZ-232): `tarn_run` MCP tool now resolves `tarn.env.yaml` from the project root (matching CLI behavior) instead of only looking in the test file's directory

### Improvements

- **AI-optimized JSON output** (NAZ-235, NAZ-234):
  - `response_status` and `response_summary` fields on all steps (passed and failed) — AI agents can see what a passed step returned without forcing a failure
  - `captures_set` field on steps listing which capture variables were set
  - `captures` map on test groups showing all captured values at end of test
  - Response bodies truncated to ~200 chars in `--json-mode compact`
  - `response_summary` provides brief descriptions like `"200 OK: Array[20]"` or `"403 Forbidden: error message"`
- **JSONPath array search** (NAZ-230): documented and tested that wildcard paths (`$[*].field`) with `contains` and filter expressions (`$[?@.field == 'value']`) work in poll `until` assertions for searching object arrays

### Schema

- Added `unresolved_template` to `failureCategory` enum
- Added optional `response_status`, `response_summary`, `captures_set` to step results
- Added optional `captures` to test results

## Unreleased

- transport and runtime parity work: proxy, TLS controls, redirects, HTTP version selection, richer cookies, form support, custom methods
- richer assertion/capture surface: whole-body diffs, more format/hash operators, status/url/header/cookie/body captures, transform-lite pipeline
- machine-oriented diagnostics: `error_code`, remediation hints, compact/verbose JSON, curl export, richer HTML, golden reporter coverage
- product DX: VS Code extension, `tarn fmt`, improved `tarn init`, docs site, Hurl migration guide, conservative Hurl importer
- project workflow: config defaults/redaction/environments, include params and overrides, auth helpers, impacted watch mode, public conformance suite
- benchmark upgrades: thresholds, exports, and timing breakdowns
